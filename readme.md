# USDL - UnStoppable DownLoads 

USDL is a decentralised file sharing application built on iExec infrastructure protocol and IPFS. 

Our goal is to empower individuals with true ownership over their contents through decentralization and cryptography. Ultimately, this empowrement means that everyone bears the sole responsibility of what they share for the good or bad of the community. 


## Economics and Value Network
We believe that a service like USDL is viable only if it serves a sustainable economical model, based on transfers of value between  network participants.
We distinguish 3 main network participants : Content Providers, Indexers, Content Consumers. The diagram below illustrated how values flows in USDL's ecosystem.

### Content Providers
The value they bring to the network is the content they produced or acquired. 
Content Providers have the option to directly sell their content's metadata (see data model section) to Indexers. 
Monetization is achieved by using iExec's marketplace built-in governance rules where dataset can be sold in exchange of $RLC (iExec's marketplace utility token)

### Indexers
The value they bring to Content Consumers is the aggregated searchable index of content. 

Indexers can choose to incentivize Content Providers i.e. buying metadata datasets on iExec's marketplace

Indexers have the option to implement their own conditional access to contents. 

- Content Consumer must have at least x $RLC in their wallet
- Content Consumer must own a given NFT 
- Content Consumer must be a Content Provider too
- ...


### Content Consumers
The value they bring to the network is their attention (traffic) that Indexers can monetize with Advertising or Affiliate platforms. 
Optionaly, they can choose to donate Content Providers for
